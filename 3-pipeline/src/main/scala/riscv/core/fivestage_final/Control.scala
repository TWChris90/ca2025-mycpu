/**
 * Advanced Hazard Detection and Control Unit: Maximum optimization
 *
 * Most sophisticated hazard detection supporting early branch resolution
 * in ID stage with comprehensive forwarding support. Achieves best
 * performance through aggressive optimization.
 *
 * Key Enhancements:
 * - **Early branch resolution**: Branches resolved in ID stage (not EX)
 * - **ID-stage forwarding**: Enables immediate branch operand comparison
 * - **Complex hazard detection**: Handles jump dependencies and multi-stage loads
 *
 * Hazard Types and Resolution:
 * 1. **Control Hazards**:
 *    - Branch taken in ID → flush only IF stage (1 cycle penalty)
 *    - Jump in ID → may need stall if operands not ready
 *
 * 2. **Data Hazards**:
 *    - Load-use for ALU → 1 cycle stall
 *    - Load-use for branch → 1-2 cycle stall depending on stage
 *    - Jump register dependencies → stall until operands ready
 *
 * Complex Scenarios Handled:
 *
 * Scenario 1 - Jump with load dependency:
 * ```
 * LW   x1, 0(x2)   # Load x1
 * JALR x3, x1, 0   # Jump to address in x1 → needs stall
 * ```
 *
 * Scenario 2 - Branch with recent ALU result:
 * ```
 * ADD x1, x2, x3   # Compute x1
 * BEQ x1, x4, label # Branch using x1 → forwarded to ID, no stall
 * ```
 *
 * Performance Impact:
 * - CPI ~1.05-1.2 (best achievable)
 * - Branch penalty reduced to 1 cycle
 * - Minimal stalls through aggressive forwarding
 *
 * @note Most complex control logic but best performance
 * @note Requires ID-stage forwarding paths for full benefit

  // ============================================================
  // [CA25: Exercise 21] Hazard Detection Summary and Analysis
  // ============================================================
  // Conceptual Exercise: Answer the following questions based on the hazard
  // detection logic implemented above
  //
  // Q1: Why do we need to stall for load-use hazards?
  // A: A stall is required because the data loaded from memory is not available immediately. The load instruction only finishes producing its result after the MEM stage, while the next instruction may need that value earlier in the EX stage. Since forwarding cannot bridge this timing gap, the pipeline must pause for one cycle to maintain correctness.
  // Hint: Consider data dependency and forwarding limitations
  //
  // Q2: What is the difference between "stall" and "flush" operations?
  // A: A stall temporarily stops the pipeline from moving forward by holding the PC and certain pipeline registers, allowing instructions to wait until required data becomes ready. In contrast, a flush removes an instruction from the pipeline by converting it into a NOP, ensuring that an incorrect or unwanted instruction does not affect execution.
  // Hint: Compare their effects on pipeline registers and PC
  //
  // Q3: Why does jump instruction with register dependency need stall?
  // A: The jump target address is determined during the ID stage in this design. If the target depends on a register whose value is still being computed by an earlier instruction, that value may not yet be available. Because results cannot be forwarded backward from later stages to ID in the same cycle, the pipeline must stall until the needed register value is ready.
  // Hint: When is jump target address available?
  //
  // Q4: In this design, why is branch penalty only 1 cycle instead of 2?
  // A: The branch decision is made earlier, specifically in the ID stage rather than the EX stage. As a result, when a branch is taken, only the instruction currently in the IF stage is incorrect and needs to be discarded. This early resolution reduces the wasted work to a single cycle.
  // Hint: Compare ID-stage vs EX-stage branch resolution
  //
  // Q5: What would happen if we removed the hazard detection logic entirely?
  // A: Without hazard detection, instructions could execute using outdated or incorrect data, leading to wrong computation results. Additionally, the processor would fail to handle control flow changes properly, causing instructions from incorrect paths to execute. Overall, the CPU would behave unpredictably and produce incorrect program behavior.
  // Hint: Consider data hazards and control flow correctness
  //
  // Q6: Complete the stall condition summary:
  // Stall is needed when:
  // 1. A load instruction in the EX stage is going to write a register that is read by the instruction currently in the ID stage. (EX stage condition)
  // 2. A branch or jump instruction in the ID stage depends on a register value that is still being generated by an instruction in the EX or MEM stage. (MEM stage condition)
  //
  // Flush is needed when:
  // 1. A branch or jump instruction is determined to be taken, requiring the instruction fetched in the IF stage to be removed to avoid executing the wrong control path. (Branch/Jump condition)
  //
